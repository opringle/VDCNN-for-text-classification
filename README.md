# VDCNN-for-text-classification
 
Following state of the art results using [deep cnn's for text classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.01781.pdf) this repo investigates drawing from the inception architecture for the same task.

## ToDo

- [ ] Option to preprocess data in hyperopt script, saving numpy arrays into S3 bucket. Remove pandas dependency from training script.
- [ ] Get Sagemaker hyperopt job running locally, on cpu with small models
